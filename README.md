## Business Intelligence for MercadoLibre Sellers

Analyse the seller competition in MercadoLibre, eBay and Amazon in a very simple way.

If you are selling in MercadoLibre there are a bunch of tools out there to use, but so far I couldn't find one that is simple enough to be used by the average seller.

## Goal

To create a very simple to use tool to explore online marketplaces like MercadoLibre, eBay and Amazon and get insights of what's being sold, what's the best way to name a product and the type of publication to use.

## Competition

In eBay.com the apps published for this segment are quite dated and range from 6 to 25 USD per month.
In MercadoLibre, they start in ~10 USD per month.

## Monetization Strategy

Even though there will be an Open Source base code, the service will be offered under a monthly fee based on the amount of data processed.

## Instalation

1. Go to [MercadoLibre Applications](https://applications.mercadolibre.com) and create an App, you will need the ID and the secret Key
2. Create a MySQL Database and dump the latest file in `/database`
3. Open `config-sample.php`, enter your App credentials and complete database info
