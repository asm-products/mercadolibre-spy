## Business Intelligence for MercadoLibre Sellers

If you are selling in MercadoLibre there are a bunch of tools out there to use, but so far I couldn't find one that is simple enough to be used by the average seller.

The goal for MercadoLibre SPY is to create a very simple to use tool to explore online markets like MercadoLibre and find the best opportunities to promote.

## Instalation

1. Go to [MercadoLibre Applications](https://applications.mercadolibre.com) and create an App, you will need the ID and the secret Key
2. Create a MySQL Database and dump the latest file in _/database_
3. Open config-samepl.php, enter your App credentials and complete database info
